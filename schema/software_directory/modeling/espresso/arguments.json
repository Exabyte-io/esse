All such arrays are distributed block-like across the `linear-algebra group`, a subgroup of the pool of processors, organized in a square 2D grid. As a consequence the number of processors in the linear-algebra group is given by n2, where n is an integer; n2 must be smaller than the number of processors in the PW group. The diagonalization is then performed in parallel using standard linear algebra operations.",
